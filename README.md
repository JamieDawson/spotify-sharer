## Frontend

The front is created using React, TypeScript, [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) for API calls, and the [react-spotify-embed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spotify-embed) NPM package to display Spotify players in React. I'm hosting the site using Vercel so users can interact with the front end.

## Backend

The backend is created using Node.js and Express.js to make the API calls to the backend. It stores the Spotify URLs in MongoDB.
